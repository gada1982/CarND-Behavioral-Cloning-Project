# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-Project
This project is done as a part of the Nanodegree - Self-Driving Car Engineer provided from Udacity. The outcome of the projct is, that a system with an artificial neuronal network should be able to learn driving a track successfully by only getting human driving behaviour as input. Images from cameras at the front (left/center/right) and steering angles are the input values. Collection of training data and testing is done within a simulator, which is provided by Udacity.

## Requirements
- Python 3.5
- Environment [CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) 
  - provided by Udacity
- Car Simulator provided by Udacity
  - [macOS](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f290_simulator-macos/simulator-macos.zip)
  - [Linux](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f0f7_simulator-linux/simulator-linux.zip)
